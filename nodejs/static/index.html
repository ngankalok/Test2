          <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline-powered cars. With instant torque, incredible power, and zero emissions, Tesla's products would be cars without compromise. Each new generation would be increasingly affordable, helping the company work towards its mission: to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. </p>
          <p>Tesla's engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla, the inventor who inspired the company's name. The resulting Tesla Roadster was launched in 2008. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and achieving a range of 245 miles per charge of its lithium ion battery, the Roadster set a new standard for electric mobility. Tesla would sell more than 2,400 Roadsters, now on the road in more than 30 countries. </p>
          <p>In 2012, Tesla launched Model S, the world's first premium electric sedan. Built from the ground up to be 100 percent electric, Model S has redefined the very concept of a four-door car. With room for seven passengers and more than 64 cubic feet of storage, Model S provides the comfort and utility of a family sedan while achieving the acceleration of a sports car: 0 to 60 mph in about five seconds. Its flat battery pack is integrated into the chassis and sits below the occupant cabin, lending the car a low center of gravity that enables outstanding road holding and handling while driving 265 miles per charge. Model S was named Motor Trend's 2013 Car of the Year and achieved a 5-star safety rating from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. </p>
          <p>In late 2014, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled two dual motor all-wheel drive configurations of Model S that further improve the vehicle's handling and performance. The 85D features a high efficiency motor at the front and rear, giving the car unparalleled control of traction in all conditions. The P85D pairs a high efficiency front motor with a performance rear motor for supercar acceleration, achieving a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.2 seconds - the fastest four-door production car ever made. </p>
          <p>Tesla owners enjoy the benefit of charging at home so they never have to visit a gas station or spend a cent on gasoline. For long distance journeys, Tesla's Supercharger network provides convenient access to high speed charging, replenishing half a charge in as little as 20 minutes. Superchargers now connect popular routes in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. </p>
          <p>Tesla's vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, previously home to New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. The Tesla Factory has returned thousands of jobs to the area and is capable of producing 2,000 cars a week. </p>
          <p>The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint into other areas, including in Tilburg, the Netherlands, where it has an assembly facility, and Lathrop, California, where it has a specialized production plant. To reduce the costs of lithium ion battery packs, Tesla and key strategic partners including Panasonic have begun construction of a gigafactory in Nevada that will facilitate the production of a mass-market affordable vehicle, Model 3. By 2018, the gigafactory will produce more lithium ion cells than all of the world's combined output in 2013. The gigafactory will also produce battery packs intended for use in stationary storage, helping to improve robustness of the electrical grid, reduce energy costs for businesses and residences, and provide a backup supply of power. </p>
          <p>Tesla is not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation. </p>

              <h1 class="section-title section-title--hed">Performance and safety refined</h1>
              <p class="section-description section-description--dek">Model S is designed from the ground up to be the safest, most exhilarating saloon on the road. With unparalleled performance delivered through Tesla's unique, all-electric powertrain, Model S accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in as little as 2.5 seconds. Model S comes with Autopilot capabilities designed to make your highway driving not only safer, but stress free.</p>
              <h4 class="section-sub-title">Adaptive Lighting</h4>
              <p class="section-description">Model S now features full LED adaptive headlamps. Besides enhancing the already great styling, they also boost safety: 14 three-position LED dynamic turning lights improve visibility at night, especially on winding roads.</p>
              <h4 class="section-sub-title">Bio-Weapon Defense Mode</h4>
              <p class="section-description">Model S now features a Medical grade HEPA air filtration system, which removes at least 99.97% of particulate exhaust pollution and effectively all allergens, bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air. The bioweapon defense mode creates positive pressure inside the cabin to protect occupants.</p>
              <p class="section-description">Dual Motor Model S is a categorical improvement on conventional all-wheel drive systems. With two motors, one in the front and one in the rear, Model S digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The result is unparalleled traction control in all conditions.</p>
              <p class="section-description">Conventional all-wheel drive cars employ complex mechanical linkages to distribute power from a single engine to all four wheels. This sacrifices efficiency in favor of all weather traction. In contrast, each Model S motor is lighter, smaller and more efficient than its rear wheel drive counterpart, providing both improved range and faster acceleration.</p>
              <p class="section-description">Model S Performance comes standard with All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor, pairing the high performance rear motor with a high efficiency front motor to achieve supercar acceleration, from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.</p>
              <h1 class="section-title section-title--hed">Built around the driver</h1>
              <p class="section-description section-description--dek">Model S is a driver's car. The cabin combines meticulous noise engineering with Tesla's uniquely quiet powertrain to obtain the sound dynamics of a recording studio. The gem of the interior is the 17 inch touchscreen, which is angled toward the driver and includes both day and night modes for better visibility without distraction. It puts rich content at your fingertips and provides mobile connectivity so you can easily find your destination, favourite song, or a new restaurant.</p>
              <p class="section-description">Model S is designed from the ground up to be the safest car on the road. Much of its safety is owed to the unique electric drivetrain that sits beneath the car's aluminium occupant cell in its own subframe. This unique positioning both lowers the car's centre of gravity, which improves handling and minimises rollover risk, and replaces the heavy engine block with impact absorbing boron steel rails.</p>
              <p class="section-description">Side impacts are met by aluminum pillars reinforced with steel rails to reduce intrusion, protecting occupants and the battery pack while improving roof stiffness. In the event of an accident, six airbags protect front and rear occupants, and the high voltage power source is automatically disconnected.</p>

              <h1 class="section-title section-title--hed">Meet Model X</h1>
      <p class="section-description">
                              Model X is the safest, fastest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history. With all-wheel drive and a 100 kWh battery providing 351 miles of range, Model X has ample seating for seven adults and all of their gear. And it's ludicrously fast, accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in as quick as 2.9 seconds. <br class="hide-on-mobile" />Model X is the SUV uncompromised.
      </p>
      <p class="section-description">All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model 3, have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.</p>
      <h1 class="section-title section-title--hed">Safety First Design</h1>
        <p class="section-description">Model X is designed with safety as the first priority. The floor-mounted battery lowers the centre of gravity so that the risk of rollover is about half that of any vehicle in its class. The battery structure strengthens Model X against side impact intrusions. And without a gasoline engine, the large front trunk acts as a giant impact-absorbing crumple zone. Although the Euro NCAP has not yet conducted crash testing on Model X, Tesla's own internally conducted crash testing indicates that Model X should be the first SUV to receive the highest safety rating in every category.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="section-sub-header">Active Safety</h4>
            <p class="section-description">Active safety technologies, including collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking, have begun rolling out through over-the-air updates.</p>
            <h4 class="section-sub-header">Pollution Free, Inside and Out</h4>
            <p class="section-description">A medical grade HEPA filter strips outside air of pollen, bacteria, viruses and pollution before circulating it into the cabin. There are three modes: circulate with outside air, re-circulate inside air and a bioweapon defense mode that creates positive pressure inside the cabin to protect occupants.</p>
            <h1 class="section-title">Introducing 8.0</h1>
  <p class="section-description">Software update 8.0 is the most significant over-the-air redesign of the Tesla touchscreen since the launch of Model S in 2012. Combining a modern look with functional updates to the Media Player, Autopilot, Maps and Trip Planner for a safer, more advanced driving experience.</p>
  <h1 class="section-title section-title--hed">Falcon Wings</h1>
        <p class="section-description">Falcon Wing doors allow easy access to second and third row seats from even a tight parking space, while traditional SUV doors or Minivan sliding doors would not grant any access.</p>
        <p class="section-description">With only a foot of clearance on either side, Falcon Wing doors articulate smoothly up and out of the way, allowing passengers to enter from both front and rear directions. The side and overhead opening is so large that parents can buckle children in without ducking or straining and without bumping their child's head on the roof.</p>
        <h2 class="section-title section-title--hed">Aerodynamic</h2>
        <p class="section-description">Model X is able to achieve 289 miles of range in part because it is the most aerodynamic SUV in production. At 0.24, Model X's drag coefficient is 20% lower than the next best SUV. In addition, an active spoiler deploys from the rear liftgate to optimize highway efficiency and stability.</p>
